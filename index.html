  Chennai being the 4th largest city and the 6th most populated region in the
  country has seen a surge in its demographic. This is due to a record migration
  of students and working professionals from different parts of the nation. With
  this rise of inhabitants, it has become a daunting task to choose the best PG
  in Chennai, especially in hotspots such as Porur, Pallavaram, or Nungambakkam.

<h2>PG in Chennai</h2>

  for students and white-collar workers. We strive to offer 360-degree services

  Most people consider Stanza Living to be a pretty decent PG in Chennai for
  students & working professionals. But those who live inside its four walls
  know that it's much, much more than any

  or Pallavaram. Because they know that no PG in Chennai, be it in Anna Nagar,
  Guindy or Nungambakkam, has professional room cleaning and laundry,
  customisable meals and a common area that's absolutely lit. Now, let us guess.
  You're thinking, what do they call it, if not a male PG or female PG near
  Kelambakam or Navalur or Sholinganallur? They call it what it feels like -
  their second home.

<h2>Benefits of Staying in Paying Guest in Chennai</h2>
<p>
  Currently, PGs in Chennai have been the most sought-after living option
  because of the pool of working professionals and students shifting from other
  cities to Chennai. With the rise in the number of IT
  companies/Startups/Universities in the city, higher demand for PG hostels in
  Chennai has been experienced by the real estate agents. You must be wondering,
  why is it so?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Imagine renting out a whole flat by yourself, and maintaining it by yourself.
  Then finding trustworthy roommates to split the bills and ensuring the hygiene
  and security of your flat by yourself- sounds exhausting, right? You are
  giving more money, more time and adding more stress to your schedule. This is
  not the case with PGs in Chennai. The prime benefits of staying in the best PG
  in Chennai are-
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced security</li>
  <li>Lively environment with like-minded people</li>
  <li>Meeting medical emergencies round-the-clock</li>
  <li>Timely maintenance of your room&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Along with these prime benefits, Stanza Living also brings options in men and

  option in Chennai. Prior to your booking, you will get a 3D virtual tour,
  which will help you make an informed decision beforehand.&nbsp;

<h2>Things to remember while renting a PG in Chennai</h2>
<p>
  You've probably heard it before, but the first thing to keep in mind while
  renting a PG for men or PG for women in Chennai is rent. More so if it's close
  to Padur or Siruseri. After the rent, comes what you get in return for that
  rent. For example, is there adequate furniture in that PG hostel? Or will your
  shoe rack also become your book shelf? Do you also get meals three times a
  day? Is the room cleaned daily or once/twice a week? Now, don't get frightened
  by the long list. Because we've gone through it for you, when we designed the
  Stanza Living experience. So if you choose to come live with us, you can
  forget this list. We've done all the remembering for you and compiled a list
  of our best residences:

<h2>What to look for in a PG accommodation in Chennai?</h2>
<p>
  Long story short - the list of things to look for in a PG accommodation is
  pretty, pretty, pretty long. There used to be a time when just a bed to sleep
  in, a desk to work/study at, and food to eat were enough. But that was in the
  year 2000, not the 2020s. This is the 2020s we're talking about. Today, a
  great boys or girls PG with AC should also have high-speed Wi-Fi, meals you
  can customise through an app, professional-quality housekeeping and more. Too
  cool, right? So cool in fact, that you feel calling it a PG is not enough. A
  heavy name like modern coliving solution sounds more apt. But there is
  another, less heavy name for it - Stanza Living.
